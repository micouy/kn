///
/// 1. Path's components are compared from the "left" (parent then child).
/// 2. Components are first ordered based on how well they match the abbreviation â€” [`Full`](Congruence::Full)
///    then [`Prefix`](Congruence::Prefix) then [`Subseries`](Congruence::Subseries) then [`Wildcard`](Congruence::Wildcard).
/// 3. Multiple components with the same match strength, either [`Prefix`](Congruence::Prefix) or [`Subseries`](Congruence::Subseries),
///    are ordered according to the Levenshtein distance between the component and the abbreviation (smaller then greater).
/// 4. If the order of two components cannot be resolved based on the above, [`alphanumeric_sort`](https://docs.rs/alphanumeric-sort) is used.
